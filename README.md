# Project: API Response Faker

## üë• Team Information
- **Team Members**: Solo project

## üéØ Project Vision

**Problem Statement**:  
During development, it‚Äôs common to need API responses from services that haven‚Äôt been implemented yet or are temporarily unavailable. This leads to blocked UI progress or error-prone mocking.

**Target Users**:  
- Frontend developers
- QA engineers
- Backend teams working with incomplete service contracts

**Value Proposition**:  
This tool allows users to set up fake API rules dynamically, simulating real responses. With a user-friendly UI and flexible backend, teams can prototype, test, or develop without needing a live backend.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Design

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **UI Styling**: TailwindCSS + Material UI (DataGrid)
- **Notifications**: React Toastify
- **API Requests**: Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (with better-sqlite3)

### System Architecture
- **Component Hierarchy**:
  - `App.tsx`
    - `RulesTable`
    - `RuleForm`
    - `ToastContainer`
- **API Design**:
  - `GET /rules`: Fetch all rules
  - `POST /rules`: Add a new fake rule
  - `ANY *`: Catch-all mock responder
- **Database Schema**:
  - `api_rules`: Stores `path`, `method`, `code`, `response`, `body`
- **Authentication**: None required for this tool (trusted local/development use only)

### Key Design Decisions
- Used `better-sqlite3` for its simplicity and performance in small-scale mock DBs.
- Built custom logic to match fake routes using HTTP method and path.
- Used Material UI `DataGrid` for better performance and flexibility in displaying rule sets.

## üß™ Test-Driven Development Strategy

### Core Features to Test:
- Rule creation form (validations)
- API rule matching logic (backend catch-all)
- Database uniqueness enforcement
- JSON response rendering in frontend

### Testing Approach:
- Manual testing with known paths/methods
- Devtools + Postman for backend rule match verification

### Test Coverage Goals:
- Future scope includes integrating Jest + Supertest for backend
- Cypress for end-to-end frontend tests

## üì¶ Feature Breakdown

### Core Features (Must-Have)
- [x] Form to define fake API rules (`path`, `method`, `code`, `response`, `body`)
- [x] Table to display all rules (MUI DataGrid)
- [x] Catch-all backend route to simulate fake endpoints
- [x] SQLite storage with fast lookup
- [x] Toast notifications for user feedback

### Enhanced Features (Nice-to-Have)
- [ ] Dynamic route support (e.g. `/users/:id`)
- [ ] Response delay simulation
- [ ] Headers support
- [ ] Import/export rule set
- [ ] Auth-protected admin panel

## üìÖ Development Plan

### 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] Setup React + Tailwind + MUI
- [x] Setup Express + SQLite + TypeScript
- [x] Setup DB schema and init script

### 2: Minimal App + Testing
- [x] Implement rule creation + display UI
- [x] Create `/rules` API endpoints
- [x] Basic form validation
- [x] Connect Axios to backend

### 3: Mock Route Logic
- [x] Implement catch-all route (`app.all('*')`)
- [x] Match requests with DB rules
- [x] Parse and send JSON response
- [ ] Add optional response headers/delay

### 4: UI Polish + Final Touches
- [x] Add toasts and error feedback
- [x] Screenshot documentation
- [x] README and demo setup
- [ ] (Optional) Unit testing

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy
- **Current**: Local development only
- **Future Plans**:
  - Containerized with Docker
  - Deploy via Render or Railway for staging
  - Use `.env` for config (port, DB path)

---

## üìö Documentation Plan
- **README**: Project vision, architecture, usage, stack
- **Screenshots**: 3 key UI screens included (form, table, response test)
- **API Docs**:
  - `GET /rules` ‚Äì return all stored rules
  - `POST /rules` ‚Äì create a new fake rule
  - `*` wildcard ‚Äì return mock data if rule matches
- **Database Docs**:
  - `api_rules (id, path, method, code, response, body)`
- **Testing Docs**: Manual testing flow (future: Jest test suite)

## ü§î Potential Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1**: Matching dynamic paths (e.g. `/users/:id`)  
- *Solution approach*: Use `path-to-regexp` to normalize and match parameters.

**Challenge 2**: SQLite `NULL` values bypassing uniqueness  
- *Solution approach*: Normalize `null` values to empty strings and check manually before insert.

**Challenge 3**: Managing user inputted JSON (validation)  
- *Solution approach*: Use `try/catch` and `JSON.stringify` safely with fallbacks and proper error toasts.

---

## üìà Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: All rules create, list, and simulate endpoints accurately
- **Code Quality**: Uses TypeScript types throughout; modular and clean
- **Performance**: Fast DB reads with `better-sqlite3`; responsive UI
- **User Experience**: Clean form, clear errors, responsive table, and toast feedback
